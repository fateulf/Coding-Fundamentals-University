        <h2>Exercise Answers</h2>
        <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
        <p>Download a file containing the following code from the unit website. The code contains seven errors. Use debugging tools and techniques 
            to identify and correct all of the errors.</p>
        <p>The corrected script prompts the user to enter the price of a book without a leading dollar sign. If the user does not enter a valid 
            price, the script repeatedly prompts them until they do. When the user enters a valid price, the script calculates the total price of 
            the book by adding a $10 shipping charge, and displays the answer in an alert box.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>   
        <p>Download a file containing the following code from the unit website. The code contains seven errors. Use debugging tools and 
            techniques to identify and correct all of the errors.</p>
        <p>The corrected script prompts the user to guess one of the ten most popular dog names in Australia. 
            If the user does not enter a name, the script repeatedly prompts them until they do. When the user enters a name, the script uses 
            a for loop to check if the name appears in an array of the ten most popular dog names in Australia. If the name is found in the 
            array, a variable named match is assigned the value true, otherwise it is false. Finally, an alert box appears, telling the user 
            whether the name they entered is one of the ten most popular dog names in Australia, or not.</p>

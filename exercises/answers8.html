    <h2>Exercise Answers</h2>
    <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
    <p>Write a script that creates a direct instance of an object named bankAccount that represents an individual's bank account. Give the 
        object three properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>customerName</i>, which stores the name of the account owner;</li>
        <li><i>bankName</i>, which stores the name of the bank where the account is held; and</li>
        <li><i>balance</i>, which stores the balance of the account in dollars.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prompt the user to enter values for the three properties and store them in the object. Then display an alert box that displays the 
        answers. For example, the alert box might read, 'Jane Smith has an account with Westpac with a balance of $5500'.</p>

        object.</p>

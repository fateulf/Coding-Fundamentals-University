        <h2>Exercise Answers</h2>
        <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
        <p>Write a script that uses the confirm() function to ask the user 'Are you sure you want to do that?' If the user clicks the OK 
            button, display an alert box saying 'You said yes.' If the user clicks the Cancel button, display an alert box saying 'You said 
            no.'</p>
        <a href="exercise6-1.html">Confirm Function</a>
        <h3>Exercise 2</h3>
        <p>Write a function named gallonsToLitres() that accepts a volume in gallons as an argument and returns the equivalent volume in 
            litres. Write a script to test the correctness of the function. There are 4.5 litres in a gallon.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
        <p>Create an HTML document named survey.html that contains the following text.<br /><br />
            <b>Completely Unbiased Survey of Student Satisfaction</b><br />
            Is DGTL11006 the best unit you have ever taken?<br />
            Yes<br />
            No<br />
            Make the words Yes and No hypertext links to an HTML document named thank-you.html that contains the following text.<br />
            "<b>Thank you</b><br />
            Strangely enough, that's what everybody says. Thank you for your feedback."<br />
            This survey will not be as unbiased as its title suggests. In the survey.html document, use an onmouseover event handler to 
            ensure that every time the user positions the mouse pointer over the word No an alert box appears with the question 'Would you 
            like to reconsider your decision?' If you do this correctly, the user should never be able to click on the word No.</p>

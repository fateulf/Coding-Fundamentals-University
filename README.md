# About
This project has all the exercises I had to complete for my coding fundamentals unit at university. The unit was primarily concerned with JavaScript and web development. Due to personal circumstances, I was unable to finish any of my units or attend the classes for the semester, so instead I chose to go through the weekly modules to complete them in my own time after the unit was over.

I haven't added my assignments in case they are using the same assignments for future semesters, since it is against the rules to post my solutions to the unit's assignments online. However, the assignments are pretty similar to the exercises, anyway.
